# Pandoc Configuration Files #
This is my "live" Pandoc data directory contents (default location: `$HOME/.local/share/pandoc/` on macOS and Linux). I usually use [`pandocomatic`](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic) to manage Pandoc via my [`pandocomatic.yaml`](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml) configuration file. Pandocomatic automates all Pandoc settings, so you simply assign one or more "recipes" in your document metadata (docx-refs, latex-letter etc.) and the correct Pandoc settings are used for you. Pandocomatic can also run pre– and post–processing scripts to help with tweaks Pandoc may not be able to implement directly. Some of my pandocomatic recipes are also available as [defaults files](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#defaults-files) callable directly using `pandoc -d`

Most of my writing is academic in nature. I generally use my pandocomatic recipes triggered automagically via Scrivener's post-processing compile feature; see [Scrivomatic](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic) for more details of the workflow. My templates and filters are customised: I've collected and modified several [Pandoc templates](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/templates) and use a [set of filters to transform Academic metadata](https://github.com/iandol/dotpandoc/tree/master/filters) to multiple outputs; my filters are written in Ruby using [https://github.com/htdebeer/paru](Paru).
