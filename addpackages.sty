%% File   : addstyles.sty
%% Purpose: To include project specific packages without the need to insert
%%          multiplpe `header-includes:` statements in the 
%%          pandocomatic.yaml configuration file. 
%%          Although there is no functional difference between both approaches,
%%          for me this file seems to provide me with a more simple overview
%%          about which packages and their whereabouts. 
%%          Note that for this approach to work, you need to insert the name
%%          of this file in the `header-includes:` statement.

%   One can make a differentiation in where to store specific addons to your
%   LaTeX environment:
%   - Generics, i.e., re-usable ones, are maintained in folders below your TeX  
%     home directory. Use `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME` at the command prompt 
%     to find your TeX Home. But respect the TeX Directory Structure (TDS) from
%     TeX Home downwards.
%   - Project specific stuff can be maintained in the same folder as your 
%     document for this project. 
%   No particular assumptions are made by the elsarticle templates with regard to 
%   locations of files.

%\usepackage{myBrilliantlyGenericStyleFile}

\usepackage{cleveref}		% sourced from http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref/cleveref.pdf 
                            % Makes varioref clever, and reuses its work to improve its own workings. 
							% The cleveref package must be loaded after all other packages that 
                            % don’t specifically support it. Therefore, to be safe, we declare it as last 
                            % in the document's preamble.
							% Also note that all \newtheorem definitions must be placed after the 
                            % cleveref package is loaded.
